# Project Reflection:

# Q: Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
# A: DriverPass is a company that wished to fill a void in the market by providing users with the ability to take online practice tests as well as in-person driving lessons in order to help their users pass the DMV driving test. A web-based application using cloud infrastructure was requested so as to minimize the client's workload in terms of backups, security, and maintenance. 

# Q: What did you do particularly well?
# A: I feel I did particularly well at designing the UML diagrams, particularly the use case diagram.

# Q: If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
# A: I would revise my work on the requirements document as I feel I particularly struggled with the non-functional requirements for this system. In order to improve it I would take more time analyzing the mock interview we received and try looking at the system from different perspectives.

# Q: How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
# A: I carefully read the mock interview and took notes regarding the specific functions that the client requested that their system needed to perform and then applied those to what the end-user would expect to see from the system. I then delved deeper into those needs to decide what other requirements would be necessary in order to meet those functional goals for the client and ultimately the user. It is critical to consider the user's needs because they are the reason that the client is wanting to create this system in the first place. Without the user, the system would be pointless.

# Q: How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
# A: I first envision what I would expect from the system as an end-user and then work backwards through the requirements I have been given by the client in order to create a working system that ultimately meets those "expectations" while using the client's feedback to modify the system as necessary. I also consistently revisited the requirements list I had originally created in order to make sure nothing was missed. These techniques have been effective thus far, and I feel as though they will continue to be useful as I continue my education and career.
